# StackStorm Weather Oracle Smart Contract

This Clarity smart contract provides a **decentralized weather data oracle** system on the Stacks blockchain. Devices stake tokens, submit weather data, and earn rewards through a community-driven validation and governance process. The contract enforces data integrity, penalizes faulty submissions, and enables parameter governance through proposals and voting.

## üìú Features

* **Device Registration & Staking:** Devices register with location metadata and stake STX to participate.
* **Weather Data Submission:** Devices submit temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed data.
* **Consensus Validation:** Data is validated against consensus values and rewarded if within deviation limits.
* **Accuracy Enforcement:** Devices with low accuracy or prolonged inactivity are penalized.
* **Governance Mechanism:** Stakeholders propose and vote on parameter updates with weighted voting.
* **Penalties & Rewards:** Devices are incentivized to submit reliable data and penalized for inconsistencies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Codes

| Error  | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `u401` | Not authorized                 |
| `u402` | Device already exists          |
| `u403` | Invalid stake amount           |
| `u404` | Device not found               |
| `u405` | Invalid or missing data        |

## üß† Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation:** Devices with double the minimum stake can propose parameter changes.
2. **Voting:** One vote per device. Stake is required to participate.
3. **Quorum & Threshold:** Voting period ends after `1440` blocks. 75% majority required to pass.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Design Principles

* **Stake-based trust:** STX staking ensures economic commitment.
* **Decentralized validation:** Community-driven data accuracy enforcement.
* **Immutable history:** Every submission and vote recorded on-chain.
* **Governance resilience:** On-chain proposals empower protocol updates.

## üß™ Example Use Case

1. Alice registers her weather station device in Chicago.
2. She stakes 150 STX using `stake-device`.
3. The device submits data every hour using `submit-data`.
4. Community validators use `validate-data` to check accuracy.
5. Alice earns STX rewards for accurate data.
6. After 30 days, she proposes increasing `reward-per-submission` using `create-proposal`.
